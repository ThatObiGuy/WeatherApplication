# WeatherApplication

## Instalment 2 in the series.
This web app allows users to enter a location and recieve weather information relevent to the given location.

Learned about some about CORS. Used VScode's live server extension to run.
really reiled on console.log() for debugging and that's be the best part of this mini-project.

In the next installment we'll see another step-up with the inclusion of databases.
